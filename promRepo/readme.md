# PROM repo 
Provide an indexed, annotated, repository of PRO measures.

## Purpose/Goals
- Satisfy the need for a searchable repository that contains validation and intended use.
- Facilitate integration of results into EHRs by providing instruments as a standard FHIR questionnaire, and encourage users to submit questionnaires engineered for specific vendors.
- Encourage correct and appropriate usage of measures by providing appropriate metadata within questionnaires, and providing a searching platform.

## Components
- Design & develop: FHIR extension for meta data.
    - I have no idea what goes into this. Is this scary?
- Engineer: backend for repo
- Design & develop: repo front end

## Additional features
- Instruments are administered via the openPRO Platform
